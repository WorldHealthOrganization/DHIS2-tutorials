# DHIS2 tutorials for Entomology and Vector Control
The standard tutorials for entomology and vector control have been developed to support the use of the  [DHIS2 standard modules for entomology and vector control](https://www.who.int/teams/global-malaria-programme/prevention/vector-control/dhis-data-collection-and-collation-tools).

  * ITN bioefficacy monitoring, 
  * IRS residual efficacy monitoring, 
  * insecticide resistance monitoring, 
  * adult mosquito surveillance and identification, including individual mosquito laboratory results
  * monitoring of mosquito larval habitats.

These tutorials can be installed in any DHIS2 instance through the [DHIS2 Training App](https://github.com/WorldHealthOrganization/training-app-blessed), an application developed by WHO to build and deliver these tutorials to the users. Once installed in the DHIS2 Training App, the tutorials remain available for users to easily open them any time they need support.

The tutorials can be dowloaded at:
https://github.com/WorldHealthOrganization/DHIS2-tutorials/tree/GMP/VCR

The following sufixes are used to label tutorials of different types:

  * DC: for tutorials on data collection processes
  * VZ: for tutorials on data visualization processes
  * EX: for tutorials on data export and import processes.
  

A **[demo of the modules](https://extranet.who.int/dhis2-ento-vc)** including the tutorials is available.

More information on the modules and other tools designed to facilitate their implementation can be found in [this page](https://www.who.int/teams/global-malaria-programme/prevention/vector-control/dhis-data-collection-and-collation-tools)
