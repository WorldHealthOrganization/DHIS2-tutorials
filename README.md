# WHO DHIS2 tutorials for DHIS2 standard packages
The WHO tutorials for DHIS2 consist of tutorials that show users how to collect or visualize data for specific thematic areas in a interactive manner and from within DHIS2.
They are provided to the user through the [DHIS2 Training App](https://github.com/WorldHealthOrganization/training-app-blessed), an application developed by WHO to build and deliver these tutorials to the users. Once installed in a DHIS2 instance, the tutorials remain available for users to easily open them any time they need support.
